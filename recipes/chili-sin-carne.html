                Mince garlic, onions and carrots and soak the granulate in water for needed 
                amount of time. If you're using tofu, you can skip this step.

            <li><h4>Cooking</h4>
                Roast the minced veggies altogether with the vegan meat in a pan with some 
                vegetable oil. Add chili, pepper, tomato-paste and stir-fry shortly. Afterwards 
                you can add tomatoes, broth, kidney beans, corn as well as salt, pepper or sugar.
                </br>
                Let it simmer for 20-30 minutes on low heat, meanwhile cook the rice.
                Lastly, give it some taste-testing and season to your liking. 
                Enjoy!
